3. Add one To number
    * Converting Array of digits of number to another array of digits by adding 1
    * Removing leading zeros if present
    * If direcly converted from array to number -> may lead to overlflow for large array

4. Minimum steps in an infinite grid
    * You are in an infinite 2D grid where you can move in any of the 8 directions
    * You are given a sequence of points and the order in which you need to cover the       points. Give the minimum number of steps in which you can achieve it. You start from the first point.
